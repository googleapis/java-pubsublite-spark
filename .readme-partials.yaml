  ## Requirements

  ### Creating a new subscription or using an existing subscription

   Follow [the instruction](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/lite/docs/quickstart#create_a_lite_subscription) to create a new subscription or use an existing subscription. If using an existing subscription, the connector will read from the oldest unacknowledged message in the subscription.

  ### Creating a Google Cloud Dataproc cluster (Optional)

   If you do not have an Apache Spark environment, you can create a [Cloud Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs) cluster with pre-configured auth. The following examples assume you are using Cloud Dataproc, but you can use `spark-submit` on any cluster.

    ```
    MY_CLUSTER=...
    gcloud dataproc clusters create "$MY_CLUSTER"
    ```

  ## Downloading and Using the Connector

  <!--- TODO(jiangmichael): Release on Maven Central and add Maven Central link -->
    The connector will be available from the Maven Central repository. It can be used using the `--packages` option or the `spark.jars.packages` configuration property.

  <!--
    | Scala version | Connector Artifact |
    | --- | --- |
    | Scala 2.11 | `com.google.cloud.pubsublite.spark:pubsublite-spark-sql-streaming:0.1.0:with-dependencies` |
  -->

  <!--- TODO(jiangmichael): Add exmaple code and brief description here -->

  ## Usage

  ### Reading data from Pub/Sub Lite

    ```python
    df = spark.readStream \
      .option("pubsublite.subscription", "projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/$LOCATION/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID")
      .format("pubsublite") \
      .load
    ```

    Note that the connector supports both MicroBatch Processing and [Continuous Processing](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html#continuous-processing).

  ### Properties

  The connector supports a number of options to configure the read:

    | Option | Type | Required | Default Value | Meaning |
    | ------ | ---- | -------- | ------------- | ------- |
    | pubsublite.subscription | String | Y | | Full subscription path that the connector will read from. |
    | pubsublite.flowcontrol.byteoutstandingperpartition | Long | N | 50_000_000 | Max number of bytes per partition that will be cached in workers before Spark processes the messages. |
    | pubsublite.flowcontrol.messageoutstandingperpartition | Long | N | Long.MAX | Max number of messages per partition that will be cached in workers before Spark processes the messages. |
    | pubsublite.flowcontrol.maxmessagesperbatch | Long | N | Long.MAX | Max number of messages in micro batch. |
    | gcp.credentials.key | String | N | [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#automatically) | Service account JSON in base64. |

  ### Data Schema

  The connector has fixed data schema as follows:

    | Data Field | Spark Data Type | Notes |
    | ---------- | --------------- | ----- |
    | subscription | StringType | Full subscription path |
    | partition | LongType | |
    | offset | LongType | |
    | key | BinaryType | |
    | data | BinaryType | |
    | attributes | MapType\[StringType, ArrayType\[BinaryType\]\] | |
    | publish_timestamp | TimestampType | |
    | event_timestamp | TimestampType | Nullable |

  ## Building the Connector

  The connector is built using Maven. Following command creates a JAR file with shaded dependencies:

    ```sh
    mvn package
    ```

  ## FAQ

  ### What is the cost for the Pub/Sub Lite?

  See the [Pub/Sub Lite pricing documentation](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/lite/pricing).

  ### Can I configure the number of Spark partitions?

  No, the number of Spark partitions is set to be the number of Pub/Sub Lite partitions of the topic that the subscription is attached to.

  ### How do I authenticate outside Cloud Compute Engine / Cloud Dataproc?

  Use a service account JSON key and `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` as described [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started).

  Credentials can be provided with `gcp.credentials.key` option, it needs to be passed in as a base64-encoded string.

  Example:
    ```java
    spark.readStream.format("pubsublite").option("gcp.credentials.key", "<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_IN_BASE64>")
    ```
about: |
  [Google Cloud Pub/Sub Lite][product-docs] is a zonal, real-time messaging
  service that lets you send and receive messages between independent
  applications. You can manually configure the throughput and storage capacity
  for Pub/Sub Lite systems.

  The Pub/Sub Lite Spark connector supports Pub/Sub Lite as an input source to
  Apache Spark Structured Streaming in both the default micro-batch processing
  mode and the _experimental_ continous processing mode. The connector works in
  all Apache Spark distributions, including [Google Cloud Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/)
  and manual Spark installations.
